# Color-Classification-CNN
Color recognition implemented in Keras.
This is an Keras implementation of CNN. The implementation supports TensorFlow backends.

The objective of the original model is to detect vehicle colors from traffic cameras.
To know more about how the model works, please refer to the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.07391.pdf)
